# Performing EDA with MySQL
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on layoffs around the world from 2020-2023, in MySQL. This is a continuation from the previous project here, https://github.com/ccollins-21/layoff_sql_cleaning. I got the original dataset from  https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv.
